Installation
===================================================================================

The MassSpectraPlot scripts need a Latex compiler for generating the plots. The scripts are tested
on Windows using the Miktex package. But it should also work on any other system.


The script is programmed using Python 2.7 with the additional installed packages:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib

For the documentation following packages are used:
   - sphinx
   - sphinxcontrib-napoleon
   - sphinx-rtd-theme


A ``requirements.txt`` for virtualenv is also available in the repository.


Generate the examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The examples can be generated by executing the ``MassSpectraPlot.py`` script.
